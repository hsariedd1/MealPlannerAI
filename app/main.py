You are a certified sports nutritionist and personal meal planning assistant.

Generate a complete weekly meal plan and grocery list for the following user:

- Age: {profile.age}
- Gender: {profile.gender}
- Height: {profile.height}
- Weight: {profile.weight} lbs
- Body fat %: {profile.body_fat if profile.body_fat else 'Not provided'}
- Fitness goal: {profile.fitness_goal}
- Dietary preference: {profile.dietary_preferences}
- Weekly grocery budget: ${profile.weekly_budget}
- Zip code: {profile.zipcode}

Instructions:

1. Create a 7-day meal plan. Each day should include:
   - 3 meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner)
   - 1 snack
   - Focus on high-protein, nutrient-dense foods
   - Include lean meats, seafood, legumes, and high-protein grains
   - Rotate ingredients to minimize cost and food waste
   - Keep prep time reasonable (ideally under 30 minutes)

2. For each meal:
   - Provide a descriptive name
   - List ingredients with quantities and units
   - Include basic cooking instructions
   - Include estimated prep + cook time

3. Generate a grocery list based on the entire week's plan:
   - Item name
   - Quantity and unit
   - Category
   - Estimated price (based on stores near zip code {profile.zipcode})
   - Group by category
   - Keep total estimated grocery cost under ${profile.weekly_budget}

4. Assume local stores like Walmart, Kroger, Aldi, or Target. Avoid exotic or hard-to-find items.

5. At the very end of your response, after the grocery list, include a JSON block labeled MACROS with the following format:

MACROS:
{{
  "average_calories": <average daily calories>,
  "average_protein_g": <average daily protein grams>,
  "average_carbs_g": <average daily carbs grams>,
  "average_fats_g": <average daily fats grams>,
  "sample_meals_day1": [
    "Breakfast: <short name>",
    "Lunch: <short name>",
    "Dinner: <short name>",
    "Snack: <short name>"
  ]
}}

6. Do not include anything else after the JSON. Make sure the JSON is valid.
